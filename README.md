1.) Clickable link to your public GitHub repo with custom README and displayed screenshot: https://github.com/DrPuffs/streaming-05-smart-smoker <br>
2.) About how long did you spend this module: 2 days. A few hours each day. <br>
3.) Could you develop custom data pipelines for analytics using RabbitMQ and the resources available to you (y/n, why): Yes. It would take some work but I believe I could put the skills together to do so. <br>
4.) What streaming analytics topics / techniques / skills do you think will be most helpful for the work you want to do: Git and reading from CSV files. <br>
5.) Describe an idea for a (relatively simple) custom analytics pipeline you might want to implement in Module 7: I would like to do something game related. Perhaps Twich viewers over time. <br>
6.) What was most difficult about this module: Again, I kind of struggled with TypeErrors. Not nearly as bad as last time, but enough to be frustrating. <br>
7.) What was most interesting: The most interesting part was developing this project from "scratch". I borrowed a lot from previous modules but I enjoyed starting from the very beginning. <br>
